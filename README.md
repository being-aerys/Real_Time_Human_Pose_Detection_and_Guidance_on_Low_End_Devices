# Real_Time_Human_Pose_Detection_and_Guidance_on_Low_End_Devices
- This work proposes a **light** network for user activity guidance (such as yoga) in real time on computationally low-end CPUs.
  - It is built on top of Lightweight OpenPose by Daniil Osokin.<br>

- The trained network is used to build a system that guides a user to learn a certain yoga by breaking it into states and providing corrective instructions throughout the activity.
- The trained **lighter** network is capable of retaining enough information to correctly identify different yoga poses while reducing the inference time by up to 4 folds.
- This is a collaborative work by Aashish Adhikari, Dhruv Jawalkar, and Sudha Ravi Javvadi.
